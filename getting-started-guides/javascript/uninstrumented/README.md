# Instrumented JavaScript Demo Fibonacci App

This is a simple web application that calculates and visualizes Fibonacci numbers. The app is built using Node.js, Express, and Chart.js.

Requires:

* Node.js 14+
* A New Relic account

## Features

- Calculate the nth Fibonacci number (1 <= n <= 90)
- Display the calculated Fibonacci number
- Visualize the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number using a line chart

## Architecture

The application is divided into two main parts:

1. **Backend**: A Node.js/Express server that exposes a REST API to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Frontend**: A browser-based single-page application that utilizes the REST API to fetch Fibonacci numbers and visualize the sequence using Chart.js.

The **frontend** code is organized in the following manner:

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the single-page application.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript code responsible for handling user input, interacting with the backend REST API, and updating the chart.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the frontend.

The **server-side** code is organized in the following manner:

- `server.js`: The main entry point of the server that sets up the Express app and listens for incoming connections.
- `routes.js`: A separate module containing the Express routes for handling the Fibonacci REST API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd getting-started-guides/javascript/instrumented
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```
The above command will use [parcel]([https://](https://parceljs.org/)) to build the frontend and start the server. 

2. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the app.
