# Getting Started Guides

This repo holds the source code for the demo apps used in the Getting Started Guides. The demo app, which is the same across all languages, is a simple fibonacci app that caluclates the nth number in the fibonacci sequence, but only 1-90. Input outside of that range is considered invalid and an exception will be thrown. 

**Instrumented**
Contains the solution (instrumented versions) of the apps. Use this to run the app locally and see data in your New Relic account. 

**Uninstrumented**
Contains the uninstrumented versions of the apps. Use this to follow along with the guide.
